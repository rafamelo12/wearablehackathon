    <h3>Participants</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone is invited to participate in this hackathon. Small teams (of up to
      4) will be formed on the first day of the hackathon. Teams with
      interdisciplinary skills are typically the most successful ones - a
      suggestion for a 'good' team mix is to have members with these skill sets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One designer</li>
      <li>One business-minded person</li>
      <li>Two developers</li>
    </ul>
