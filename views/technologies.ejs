    <p>
      The following are technologies and wearables devices that will be
      available for use at the Hackathon. Note that you have the option
      to bring your own wearable device. You can also combine different
      technologies and wearable devices together (as long as the provided
      supplies are enough to satisfy all participants needs); the only
      requirement will be that the combined solution uses the Bluemix Cloud
      platform.

              <em>IBM Bluemix</em> is a Platform as a Service (PAAS) for developers. It is
              an implementation of IBM’s Open Cloud Architecture, leveraging Cloud
              Foundry to enable developers to rapidly build, deploy, and manage
              their cloud applications, while tapping into runtime frameworks and
              services.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, you can quickly develop apps in <em>Node.js</em>,
              <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>PHP</em>, <em>Java</em>, and so on using
              services for <em>mobile</em>, <em>IoT</em> (including wearables),
              <em>big data analytics</em>, and more!.

              <em>Glance</em> is the first smart accessory that turns any watch
              into a smartwatch. Glance introduces a <em>new category</em> to
              wearable  technology of add-on accessories that means the consumer
              doesn't have to render their existing watch completely useless.
              Glance discreetly fits on to <em>any existing timepiece</em> to work
              with iOS and Android devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wearers can receive mobile and social notifications, as well as
              activate the phone finding feature with the push of a button or use
              it as an activity tracker. Glance <em>counts steps and measures
              activity levels</em>. Glance also gives your watch gesture control
              capabilities to use your hand to control your mouse. Make a thumb
              tap gesture to simulate a click.
            </p>
            <p>
              Glance is a wearable anyone can easily incorporate into their daily
              wardrobe without compromising personal style. The smart accessory
              also works with <em>Kiwi's patent pending motion recognition engine
              </em> that can be used to control connected devices such as smart
              phones, laptops and TVs.
